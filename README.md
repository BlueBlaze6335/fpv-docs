# fpv-drone-build

This started initially as my attempt to build a drone with @suresh26k. However, realizing that this is a great way to 
help budding drone builders in India to get started, we have decided to make this an open initiative. We welcome people 
who would like to contribute as they go along with their drone building projects. Help us build a knowledge base that 
a beginner would benefit most out of. 

# About the project

This project aims to act as a starting point for all Indian drone builders and enthusiasts. We want this to be a simple, 
effective and useful guide for all people who are starting out with this hobby. 

Drone building can be an expensive hobby, and beginners need to make sure that they are not flushing their money down 
the drain by buying parts that are pricey yet not the best, popular yet incompatible, and sometimes, just plain wrong.
