## Non-drone Parts (same as build 1)

The parts listed in this section refer to components/devices that are needed for flying FPV drones, but are not parts
that are added into the drone itself.

- Radio Transmitter/Controller (TX) - We recommend investing in a decent radio transmitter, as these devices work with multiple drones and will last many years. We recommend tone of the following Radio Transmitters:

  - **RadioMaster TX16S (mid range)**

    - [Buy at InsideFPV](https://www.insidefpv.com/product/radiomaster-tx16s-hall-sensor-gimbals-2-4g-16ch-multi-protocol-rf-system-opentx-mode2-transmitter-for-rc-drone-mode-2-left-hand-throttle-tx16s/)

  - **FrSky Taranis X9D Plus 2019 Special Edition (high end)**

    - [Review by Albert Kim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onjRkSSAo5w)

    - [Buy at Quadkopters](https://www.quadkopters.com/product/tx-and-rx/frsky-taranis-x9d-plus-special-edition/)

      NOTE: Make sure to go for one of the above with 'Hall Sensor' Gimbals instead of the standard potentiometer-based gimbals, which don't last long.

- **FPV Goggles** - These can become the largest singular investment in the entire build, as respectable goggles don't come cheap.
