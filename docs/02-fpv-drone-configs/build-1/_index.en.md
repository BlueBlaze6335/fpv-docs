# Drone Build Configurations

## Non-drone Parts

The parts listed in this section refer to components/devices that are needed for flying FPV drones, but are not parts
that are added into the drone itself.

- Radio Transmitter/Controller (TX) - We recommend investing in a decent radio transmitter, as these devices work with multiple drones and will last many years. We recommend tone of the following Radio Transmitters:

  - **RadioMaster TX16S (mid range)**

  - **FrSky Taranis X9D Plus 2019 Special Edition (high end)**

      NOTE: Make sure to go for one of the above with 'Hall Sensor' Gimbals instead of the standard potentiometer-based gimbals, which don't last long.

- **FPV Goggles** - These can become the largest singular investment in the entire build, as respectable goggles don't come cheap.
