## Non-drone Parts

| SL  | Component              | Brand & Model Name                          | Quantity |
| --- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------: |

The parts listed in this section refer to components/devices that are needed for flying FPV drones, but are not parts
that are added into the drone itself.

### **Transmitter/Controller**

We recommend investing in a decent radio transmitter, as these devices work with multiple drones and will last many years. We recommend tone of the following Radio Transmitters:

#### **RadioMaster TX16S (mid range)**

  NOTE: Make sure to go for one of the above with 'Hall Sensor' Gimbals instead of the standard potentiometer-based gimbals, which don't last long.

#### **FrSky Taranis X9D Plus 2019 Special Edition (high end)**

### **FPV Goggles**

![Freestyle5Inch](../../images/dji-goggles-v2.jpg){ align=left }

These can become the largest singular investment in the entire build, as respectable goggles don't come cheap. Since this is a digital build, we really have no choice here, and the [DJI v2 Goggles](https://anubisrc.com/product/dji-fpv-goggles-v2/) is the only way to go. These goggles cost anywhere between 50K to 70K INR.
