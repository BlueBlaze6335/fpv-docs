# Indian Stores for DIY Drone Purchases

The world of do-it-yourself FPV drone building comes with one critically unfortunate deficiency in India - parts/spares/replacements are more often than not, unavailable, or out of stock. You could always shop from international stores such as GetFPV, but with the customs situation in our country being what it is, you may not want to go down that road. This is because of two main reasons:

1. Customs charges for electronic items can range from anywhere between **41% to 78%** of the total cost of the product being imported. This total cost includes shipping costs too. Unless you are okay with shelling out **1.5 to 2** times the actual actual costs, importing from reputed international stores may not be the best option for us. (If you still want to go down that route, look at the last section of this page for a list of great sites to buy from.)

2. The government body that controls and regulates drone imports, DGCA, has placed a blanket-ban on civilians importing drones or drone parts. The customs department has been explicitly directed to not let any products resembling drones or drone parts through their inspections. As many of the components that we purchase would be identified easily (sometimes even explicitly declared by the shipper) as drone parts, this is a sure-fire way of inviting trouble, losing money or both.

Here are the most popular stores I would recommend purchasing from. These are Indian stores, and they come with the peace of mind that you wont be ripped off by customs at an obscene rate.

    Note however, that some of these stores do not have entirely legit establishments, and will not be able to provide you with a GST bill, online secure transactions, or both. If this is something that you are not happy about just go for the legit ones.
