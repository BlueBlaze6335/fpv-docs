    _This is a work in progress. Some sections are not yet complete. I am working on this in my spare time and I intend to have this completed soon!_ _**- Sid**_

## About the project

This started initially as my attempt to build a drone with @suresh26k. However, realizing that this is a great way to
help budding drone builders in India to get started, we have decided to make this an open initiative. We welcome people
who would like to contribute as they go along with their drone building projects. Help us build a knowledge base that
a beginner would benefit most out of.

This project aims to act as a starting point for all Indian drone builders and enthusiasts. We want this to be a simple,
effective and useful guide for all people who are starting out with this hobby.

Drone building can be an expensive hobby, and beginners need to make sure that they are not flushing their money down
the drain by buying parts that are pricey yet not the best, popular yet incompatible, and sometimes, just plain wrong.

## Read this before you begin

There are some important points to note before you begin using these docs:

1. **This project focuses mainly on FPV drones with a 5-inch form factor**. These drones are super versatile, designed for
   either racing, video-making or freestyling. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBb_kSO3vTo) to see an example
   of the kind of drones we build in this doc (freestyling type drone).
2. **Drone making needs a considerable amount of research and understanding**. Some important concepts of physics (thrust,
   load, power to name a few) come into play early into the equation. We will try our best to make this document keeping
   beginners in mind. _Note that we are beginners too when we started to write this document, and will no longer be when we
   are done with a full draft_.
3. **Drone making can become an expensive hobby**. Please be aware (with market conditions being as they are) that in
   India, drone enthusiasm is just picking up.
4. **Drone parts can become hard to find**. There will be a lot of delays when procuring the right parts for the build and
   patience will be of paramount importance. If you do not have the patience to wait weeks (to even months) for the right
   components, this may not be for you.
