# Frames

The frame is the main body of the drone. It houses all the components that make up the drone. Quadcopters usually have frames that are made of Carbon Fiber (smaller ones have plastic frames). These come in two main categories: lightweight compact frames designed for drone racing, and freestyle frames, which are usually slightly larger than racing frames, more durable and slightly heavier too.

## Choosing the right frame for your FPV drone

There are a lot of things that we need to consider when selecting a frame for the drones. Let's discuss the main ones:

- **Propeller Size** - Depending on the length of the arms of the frame, specific propeller sizes will be needed. Most common are 5" and 3" propellers, and drone frames usually support them well.

- **Usable Internal Space** - When selecting a frame, we need to consider the space available inside the frame for mounting the components. Does the frame have the right mounting-holes? Does it come with the right amount of space for all the components we will be putting into it (FC, ESC, Camera, battery, radio, antenna, etc)

- **Aerodynamics** - How well does the drone slice through the air? Bulky drones tend to meet with higher air resistance and will need more power to fly through the air. A thin nimble frame will cut through much easier and with lesser effort.

- **Strength** - A strong frame will survive many crashes before it breaks apart. A lightweight frame, on the other hand would break apart a bit more easily as they dont have the strength to withstand heavy crashes or drops. However, this can be a double-edged sword - a stronger drone would be heavier, and would need more power to fly. So a balance would need to be struck between strength and weight. Frames with 4mm thick plates are pretty durable and strong (but slightly heavier too). Also, 3mm thick frames are also available but will not be quite as strong.

- **Additional Features** - Some well designed frames come with some extra features. For example, some come with overarching support rungs that protect the camera in case of a head-on collision. Others come with capabilities to mount additional cameras like GoPros. Yet others come with power distribution boards that allow you to properly distribute power from the ESC to the motors.

**_We recommend beginners to go with freestyle 4mm thick 5" frames instead of thinner racing-style frames, for obvious reasons_**

## Power Distribution Board (PDB)

Power Distribution Boards (or PDBs) are circuit boards that help pass power from the drone battery to the various components of the drone. While these were very popular in recent times, many modern Flight Controllers (FC) come with a PDB inbuilt into the circuit, making a separate PDB unnecessary.

These usually come with many frames, and can also be separately bought if required.

**_In our build, we use a Flight Controller that already has an integrated PDB, and this component is not required._**
