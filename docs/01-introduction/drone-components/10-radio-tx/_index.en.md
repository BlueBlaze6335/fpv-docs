# Radio Transmitter (TX)

The radio transmitter is one of the main components of FPV Drone flying. This is the device we use to communicate with the drones. It transmits our inputs into radio signals that are picked up by the radio receivers that are present in the drones. These radio signals are then fed to the flight controller, which determines what the input was and how to follow this input order. These transmitters and receivers work in the 2.4GHz frequency range (considerable range) or 900MHz (very high range) and
come in many sizes and form factors.
