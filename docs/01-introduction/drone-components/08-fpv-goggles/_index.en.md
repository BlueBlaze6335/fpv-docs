# FPV Goggles

FPV Goggles are an integral part of the FPV drone racing setup. The drone pilot needs to use one of these goggles in order to successfully connect to the visual feed provided by a drone's video transmitter (VTX). Through these googles, the user would see what the drone's camera sees during flight, making FPV drone flying an immersive and addictive experience like never before.
