# Tools You Need to Build a Drone

To build a drone, we need to get a lot of separate electronic parts together. These parts come in all shapes and sizes, and we need to make sure that they are compatible with each other. In order to effectively achieve a stable solid and strong build, a few basic minimum tools are needed. Here's a list of them all

## Soldering Iron

One of the most important tools that one needs when building a drone is a soldering iron. With quads, many different components need to be connected to the flight controller or the ESC. For instance, the four motors need to be connected to the ESC, the radio module and the camera need to be connected to the flight controller, and so on. These connections need to be strong and withstand vibrations and shocks. Soldering is the best way to achieve this.

Any soldering iron with a wattage of 60W would suit well, although it is recommended to go for one that allows for varying the temperature. This is particularly important because heat is an enemy to electronic components. Being able to increase or reduce the temperature allows to work with small and large soldering jobs.

### Soldering tips

The type of soldering tip is also an important factor to consider when working on any soldering job. For most soldering jobs, two types of tips are most commonly used:

1. **Conical Tip** - Used in soldering jobs that need high precision. These are the most versatile of the lot and usable in many situations.
2. **Bevel Tip** - These tips have a large flat surface that allows to deliver more heat. Usually used for soldering jobs for large joins.

### Recommendation

Here are some notable soldering irons you could go for. All of these have digital LED for temperature check, variable temperature and replaceable tips.
