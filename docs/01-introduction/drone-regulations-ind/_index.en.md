# Drone Regulations in India

Before we get into the basics of Drone Building, we need to understand what the Indian government thinks about it. '
Let's take a look at the hobby drone-flying scene in India:

## What you should know

The following rules apply irrespective of the category of the drone. 

1. If you own a drone (defined as an RPAS or Remotely Piloted Aircraft System on the site), you need to register it with the government. This is not optional and is a mandatory requirement. 
2. Drone regulations differ based on the total weight of your drone. Each drone category comes with it's own set of rules and regulations that we need to abide by.   
3. Registration can be done by logging on to the [DGCA Digital Sky WebSite](https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in)
4. If you are planning to build a drone, or have a drone that you have built yourself, it still needs to be registered. Theres a section below that covers this scenario.

## Primary Regulations

Here are the main rules that you need to be aware of:

1. Drone pilots need to register their drones before they attempt to fly them.
2. Drones must not be flown higher than 400ft vertically. 
3. Drone pilots must always maintain line-of-sight with their drones when flying them.
3. Drones cannot be flown in no-fly zones (mostly places of national importance, military locations, airports, LoCs and so on).
4. Drones should not be used to violate the privacy of others or to harm others in any way.

## Drone Categories

The following are the different categories recognized by the DGCA as of this time of writing:

| Category | Weight Classification                                      |
|:--------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Nano	   | Less than or equal to 250 grams.                           |
| Micro	   | Greater than 250 grams and less than or equal to 2 kg.     |
| Small	   | Greater than 2 kg and less than or equal to 25 kg.         |
| Medium   | Greater than 25 kg and less than or equal to 150 kg.       |
| Large	   | Greater than 150 kg.                                       |

## Nano drones

These are drones with All Up Weight (AUW) of 250 grams or less. AUW includes any payload that the drone may be carrying. 
At the time of writing, Nano drones do not have any restrictive rules governing its use in India. These drones do not
need to be registered. Note that a nano drone will be bumped up to the micro category if it's speed exceeds 15 meters 
per second or if it can fly farther than 100m from the pilot. The drone will also be bumped up to Micro category if it 
can fly higher than 15 feet off the ground level.

Since we are primarily focused on Micro drones, this document focuses on that category alone.

## Micro Drones

### UIN Number
To fly micro drones, you need to register the drone as mentioned above, and you need to obtain a UIN (Unique 
Identification Number) for the drone. This UIN number needs to be clearly indicated on the body of the drone. 

### NPNT
This drone needs to comply with NPNT rule. NPNT stand for No Permission No TakeOff, which is a system that allows a 
drone to fly only if the drone pilot has been granted permission for a flight. This is a complicated requirement that 
requires your drone to have a GPS GLONASS chip and a SIM, allowing the drone be tracked and monitored. This particular 
regulation is pretty hard to achieve for us, and we will be attempting this compliance only after large-scale adoption 
and support for this requirement in the drone building world. 

### RTH System & GeoFencing Capabilities
Drones in the Micro category need to be equipped with the automated capability to return back to the pilot if they enter 
restricted airspace or places that they are not supposed to be flown into. This too is a complicated requirement for us 
to achieve and we will be attempting this compliance only after large-scale adoption and support for this requirement in 
the drone building world. 

### Flight Records and Logbooks
Drone pilots are required to maintain clear and concise records of their flight sessions, including information about 
flight locations, flight time, and other flight metrics. This is a manual requirement that each pilot needs to adhere to 
and is not in scope for our document.

## What about a drone that you build yourself

We intend to build our own drones instead of buying RTF (ready-to-fly) drones. In our case, our drone build is going to 
be in the micro category. The DGCA Digital Sky platform recognizes us as a drone manufacturer, and we need to register 
by operating under this assumption. Since we build our own drones, we will provide our own serial numbers for each 
drone we register. Thankfully, this is allowed and perfectly legal to do so.
